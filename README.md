Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of Amazon sales to uncover patterns in buyers' behavior. By analyzing this data, we aim to answer questions such as:

Which products are the most popular?
What are the trends in sales over time?
How do different factors such as price, category, and rating affect sales?
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains sales data from Amazon. It includes information such as:

Product ID
Product Name
Price
Rating
Sales Volume
Date of Purchase
Ensure that you have the dataset ready before running the analysis. If you donâ€™t have a dataset, you can generate a sample one using Python.

Requirements
Python 3.8 or above
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Required Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:
Analysis
The analysis is divided into several sections:

Data Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and prepare the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use visualizations to explore the data and identify trends.
Sales Trends: Analyze sales volume over time and across different categories.
Customer Preferences: Determine which products are most popular among customers.
Price Sensitivity: Assess how price changes impact sales.
Results
[Product Popularity]: The most popular products are identified based on sales volume.
[Sales Trends]: Seasonal trends and patterns in sales are visualized.
[Price Analysis]: Insight into how price impacts customer purchasing behavior.
[Category Analysis]: Comparison of different product categories and their sales performance.
